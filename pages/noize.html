                        A myriad of deeply rooted instincts and experiences propelled me to invest in a camera in the
                        late winter of 2019. I had recently visited Hong Kong with a friend and we discussed the options
                        available when choosing a camera; the amount of options is a bit daunting. Aesthetics and
                        process both became two factors that stuck with me. Being in Hong Kong, film seemed even more
                        appealing as a choice for camera. When I returned to Seoul, I decided film was the best option
                        for me and I haven’t had any other camera since I got that black canon A1. Perhaps the only
                        reason I wanted a camera and to begin taking photos with something other than my phone was to
                        document the scenery for my family—specifically my parents. They had never travelled abroad; so
                        I took pictures essentially for my mom and my dad. These next four photographs are from the
                        first couple of rolls of film I ever shot back in 2019/2020.

                        appreciate. As an expat, people back home tend to live vicariously through you; especially when
                        I would speak with my family they would always ask what it was like in Korea. All I could tell
                        them only expressed a glimmer of what I was actually seeing. I felt my pictures could function
                        as a window for people back home in general. A window through which could be seen a foreign land
                        that I was experiencing whole-heartedly.</p>

                        was a familial experience. She did this always on a disposable camera, clicking and winding
                        away. And once she started taking pictures, she couldn’t stop. I’m joyful she gets to see my
                        pictures now as I too have not stopped clicking and winding.</p>

                <p class="text-center">When I chose to travel to Korea in order to teach, one determining factor was my
                    grandfather, Joe. He fought in the Korean war. He died when he was older before I had been born. I
                    only saw him in photographs dressed in his uniform or later photographs of him when his hair started
                    to shimmer gray. I felt that my dad ought to at least be able to see the land in and through which
                    his dad experienced a war. Consequently, a lot of my early pictures were focused on anything that I
                    thought would make my dad smile. One thing that my father enjoyed later after my sisters and I grew
                    up was riding his motorcycle. In fact, it became such a distinguishing element to his persona;
                    riding with my mother holding onto him, my mom wearing the proper safety gear while my dad wore his
                    vests or just a short-sleeve and shorts. They both found joy on that motorcycle out on the open
                    roads of New Mexico, under a vast sky, constellated and coruscating now with my father’s light. I
                    never got to photograph my dad before he died; in many ways that is disheartening because I would
                    have loved to take some portraits of him on his bike or him with my mom. However much my subjects
                    change through time, the vision remains as such for me. Although, with my father’s passing it
                    saddens me beyond anything I could write (despite my attempts) that he won’t be able to see the
                    pictures that I take. Nonetheless, the intention persists.</p>
