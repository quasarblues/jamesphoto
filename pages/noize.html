                        A myriad of deeply rooted instincts and experiences propelled me to invest in a camera in the
                        late winter of 2019. I had recently visited Hong Kong with a friend and we discussed the options
                        available when choosing a camera; the amount of options is a bit daunting. Aesthetics and
                        process both became two factors that stuck with me. Being in Hong Kong, film seemed even more
                        appealing as a choice for camera. When I returned to Seoul, I decided film was the best option
                        for me and I haven’t had any other camera since I got that black canon A1. Perhaps the only
                        reason I wanted a camera and to begin taking photos with something other than my phone was to
                        document the scenery for my family—specifically my parents. They had never travelled abroad; so
                        I took pictures essentially for my mom and my dad.</p>

                    <p>I selected subjects I thought my parents would appreciate. As an expat, people easily tend to
                        live
                        vicariously through you; so then I felt my pictures could function as a window for people back
                        home
                        in general. A window through which a foreign land that I was experiencing whole-heartedly could
                        be
                        seen.</p>

                    <p>I have vivid memories of my mother documenting everything we did whenever it was a familial
                        experience. She did this always on a disposable camera, clicking and winding away. And once she
                        started taking pictures, she couldn’t stop. I’m joyful she gets to see my pictures now as I too
                        have not stopped clicking and winding. </p>

                <p>When I chose to travel to Korea in order to teach, one determining factor was my grandfather, Joe. He
                    fought in the Korean war. He died when he was older before I had been born. I only saw him in
                    photographs dressed in his uniform or later in his life when his hair started to shimmer gray. I
                    felt that my dad ought to at least be able to see the land in which and through which my grandfather
                    experienced a war. Consequently, a lot of my early pictures were focused on anything I thought would
                    make my dad smile. It remains as such for me, although, with his passing it saddens me how much he
                    won't be able to see. Nonetheless, the intention persists.</p>
